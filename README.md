# flappy-square
This is a flappy bird-like javascript game built from scratch. 

## It includes
- Physics
- Collision detection
- In-game difficulty changer

## How to play
1. Download files
2. Open index.html with your preferred browser
3. Start the game with either arrow-up or space
4. Use the arrows to avoid flying into the green obstacles
5. Catch the blue square to decrease in size and lower the difficulty
6. Beat your own highscore

## Possible improvements
- Add speeding up 
- Collision detection module instead of hardcoded
- Improve collision detection: eventhough you have collided, it could look like it doesn't, as the obstacle and the player-square are not always touching. So I should synchronize the calculation and the display in a way.
- Extra types of obstacles
